## BUGS

- Bug #1: /routes/users patch route is loosely calling the update method
- Bug #2: `getAll()` function was expected to receive username and password params/(not used on the function itself)
- Bug #3: should not be allowed to receive from query, weak security measure, risk to others having access to the server
